School project. CRYPTOGRAPHIC SYSTEMS BASED ON ELLIPTIC CURVES
As a result of the work, a program was obtained in which software encryption was implemented according to the algorithms of 
cryptographic systems based on the base of elliptic curves. Elliptic cryptography is a branch of cryptography that 
studies asymmetric cryptosystems based on elliptic curves over finite fields. The main advantage of elliptic cryptography is that 
the existence of subexponential algorithms for solving discrete logarithm problems is currently unknown. 
The use of elliptic curves to create cryptosystems was independently proposed by Neil Koblitz and Victor Miller in 1985.
